## 01. Why

You might know there already exist quite a lot of [static site generators][other-generators], why create another one? Because **they were not good enough** for [Open Game Studio][ogs] needs.

Here's a list of **features we don't need**:

| № | Unwelcome feature | Note |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Learning anything beyond HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Markdown | These technologies are enough to have a clean web site |
| 2 | Server side | Nobody should be able to pull the plug on you except yourself |
| 3 | Installation | No more forced updates that were never requested |
| 4 | Comprehensible source code | No more millions of source code files |

## 02. Features

Consequently, here is a list of **PSKOV features**:

| № | PSKOV feature | Note |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Markdown | Just what you already know |
| 2 | Client side | **PSKOV** is a client side JavaScript application, it runs solely on your device |
| 3 | Available on-line | [http://opengamestudio.org/pskov][pskov] |
| 4 | Available off-line | Just save the [Tool][pskov] page and then open it locally |
| 5 | Comprehensible source code | **PSKOV** is a single HTML file |
| 6 | Belongs to everyone | **PSKOV** is released under [CC0][cc0] license (public domain)|
| 7 | Runs for decades | You can use **PSKOV** on both Windows 2000 and Windows 2030\* |

\* Windows 2030 does not (yet) exist, we simply refer to the fact that **PSKOV** is designed to work for operating systems released in the range of years 2000-2030
