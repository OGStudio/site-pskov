## 01. Dependencies

We designed **PSKOV** to run inside web browsers. Hence, here is a list of **PSKOV dependencies**:

| â„– | Dependency | Note |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Web browser of 2010 or newer | **PSKOV** needs ECMAScript 5 (2009), any modern web browser should work |
| 2 | Local file system access (LFSA) | [LFSA][lfsa] gives **PSKOV** access to your local file system |

Since **PSKOV** is a client side JavaScript application, it has no direct access to your local file system to generate files. That's why we have also created [LFSA][lfsa], a tiny Python server to provide read/write access to your local file system at 8000 port. LFSA is under 200 lines of code, feel free to [inspect it][lfsa-src] to make sure we don't steal your data.

Tell Showdown.JS is used to convert Markdown to HTML, so users should refer to Showdown.JS for rules.
